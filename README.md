# UCL Master Project Codes 
These codes are all my programming work related with the master project ‘Hierarchical Classification Approach on Recognising Family, Genus and species of Anuran’.

The two main contributions of my dissertation are as follows: 
(1) The implementation of KNN classification to reproduce the work of previous academic research and the implementation of PCA to visualise data. Both implementations are presented in ‘KNN+and+Visualisation.ipynb’.
(2) The implementations and comparisons of more advanced classification algorithms, Logistic Regression and SVM on the existing hierarchical model. And the insights delivered from the comparisons of traditional prediction accuracy measurements and the hierarchical loss evaluations. The programming details are presented in ‘Logistic+Regression.ipynb’ and ‘SVM.ipynb’.
